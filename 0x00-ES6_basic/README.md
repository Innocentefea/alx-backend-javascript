ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to the JavaScript language specification that was released in June 2015. It introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript, making the language more expressive, powerful, and easier to work with. Here are some key features introduced in ES6:

1. let and const: ES6 introduced block-scoped variables using the `let` and `const` keywords. These variables are scoped to the nearest enclosing block (e.g., a loop, an if statement, or a function), providing more predictable and manageable variable scope.

2. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a shorter syntax, lexical `this` binding, and don't create their own `this` context. Arrow functions are especially useful for writing shorter callback functions.

3. Classes: ES6 introduced a new way to define classes in JavaScript using the `class` keyword. Classes provide a more familiar and structured object-oriented programming (OOP) syntax, including support for constructor methods, instance methods, static methods, and inheritance using the `extends` keyword.

4. Template Literals: Template literals provide an improved way to work with strings in JavaScript. They use backticks (``) to define strings and allow for easy interpolation of variables and expressions using `${}`. Template literals also support multi-line strings without the need for escape characters.

5. Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows for extracting values from arrays or objects into individual variables. It provides a concise and convenient way to work with complex data structures and can simplify code when dealing with function parameters or object properties.

6. Enhanced Object Literals: ES6 enhanced object literals by adding new syntax and features. This includes shorthand property notation, computed property names, method definitions, and the ability to define setters and getters for object properties.

7. Default Parameters: Default function parameters allow you to specify default values for function arguments. If an argument is not provided or is explicitly set to `undefined`, the default value will be used instead.

8. Rest Parameters and Spread Operators: Rest parameters (`...`) allow functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Spread operators (`...`) allow arrays or iterable objects to be expanded into individual elements. These features make it easier to work with variable-length argument lists or to combine arrays.

9. Promises: Promises provide a better way to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data or making API calls. Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allow for more readable and maintainable asynchronous code using `then()` and `catch()` methods.

10. Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module system for JavaScript, allowing for better organization and reusability of code. Modules enable developers to export and import functions, objects, or values between different files, providing better encapsulation and reducing global namespace pollution.

These are just some of the key features introduced in ES6. ES6 has brought significant improvements to JavaScript, making it a more powerful and modern programming language. Since ES6, subsequent versions of ECMAScript have been released, each introducing new features and enhancements to the language.
